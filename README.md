# Youth Help Platform (Prototype)

A lightweight web app where users can share project ideas or requests for help and others can comment or contact them.

## Setup
1. Create a **Supabase** project → copy project URL and anon key.
2. Run the SQL (`schema.sql`) in the Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Replace the placeholders in `index.html` with your keys.
4. Deploy the file on **Netlify** or **GitHub Pages**.

That’s all — your platform is live!
